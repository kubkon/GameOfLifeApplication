Missing functionality/issues:

* Simulation is significantly slower for larger world sizes and increasing number of live cells. This is due to the required rendering of the live cells at each stage of the world evolution. (parallelise?)
* More advanced GUI. Currently, it's just a 'proof-of-concept'.
